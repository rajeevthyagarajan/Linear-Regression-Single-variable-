# Linear-Regression-Single-variable-
In this scenario, we will perform linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. You are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and want to decide which city to open a new outlet in. The dataset for this problem is available in the file "Data/ex1data1.txt." It contains two columns: the population of a city (in 10,000s) and the profit of a food truck in that city (in $10,000s). A negative profit value indicates a loss.

We will load this dataset into variables x and y. The variable x will store the population data, and y will store the corresponding profit data.
